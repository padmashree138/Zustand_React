# Zustand_React
Hi, I learnt about Zustland. Here are some points :
<br/>
1. Zustand aims to enhance the developer experience by simplifying state updates.
2. It handle complex state scenarios efficiently
3. I used :
 * devtools which allows developers to inspect and debug Zustand stores
 * immer which helps in creating a draft state that can be modified without mutating the original state.
 * classNames which help in making code more concise and readable when dealing with conditional classes.
<br/>
Here is a small Zustand application.
